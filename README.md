Just your local snek... (and your friendly neighborhood pythonista). Been coding in python since late 2017 :D

Actually started programming in late 2015/early 2016, but really dude, do you count Scratch as "programming"?

Loves eating. Also likes to eat Milky Ways (not the galaxy ðŸ‘€). You can find me chilling around in [the Pygame Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZuB2RySPRJ) or playing Minecraft and Guardian Tales

## Things I'm proficient at:
- **Python** (Most proficient)
- **SQL** (Specifically MySQL)
- **HTML** (Kind of... I guess???)
- C++ (Barely can make a calculator app, so it probably has no right to be on this list)
- Networking (Ehh, I guess I'm *okay* at it... did some SFTP, FTP, sockets, and port forwarding)
- **Math** (I'd say I'm proficient at math, currently at the level of matrices and trig)
- **Piano** (Playing for... maybe 4.5-5 years now)
- Trombone (Started 1 year ago)
- **Chinese** (I am literally Chinese American)

## Some Python modules I'm "good" at:
- **Discord.py** (Most proficient)
- **Pygame** (Kinda proficient kek)
- PyQt5 (I guess...?)
